# Contributing to CONTRIBUTING.md

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ❤️

The easiest way to get start is by using free tier Gitpod. This will boot up a Linux workspace in the cloud and setup the project automatically.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/KarlTheCool/fvf-decks)

Otherwise, following the [setup tasks in .gitpod.yml](https://github.com/KarlTheCool/fvf-decks/blob/main/.gitpod.yml) will get you going just as easily.

Installing some form of ESLint, [like the plugin for vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) is recommeneded. Whatever you use should automatically detect the [.eslintrc.js](https://github.com/KarlTheCool/fvf-decks/blob/main/.eslintrc.js)

Have Fun!
